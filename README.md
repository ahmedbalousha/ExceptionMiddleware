# Simplify Error Handling with ExceptionMiddleware in .NET

In .NET applications, **ExceptionMiddleware** enables centralized error handling, making your code more organized, cleaner, and easier to maintain. Instead of scattering `try-catch` blocks throughout your code, you can handle exceptions globally in one place.

## Why Use ExceptionMiddleware?

- ✅ **Centralized Error Handling**: Keep your code clean by managing all errors in a single location.
- ✅ **Improved User Experience**: Display user-friendly, custom error messages.
- ✅ **Better Debugging**: Log detailed error information for easier troubleshooting.
- ✅ **Enhanced App Stability**: Catch unhandled exceptions and prevent crashes.
